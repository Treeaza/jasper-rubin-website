							My blog started in 2015, when I was a misty-eyed high school freshman with dreams
							of being a game developer, as a tool to try and force me to work more on
							game design. It failed quite poorly at that, and quickly became a repository
							of me explaining that I was terrible at getting things done, and a few thousand words
							about Minecraft. Now it's where I write my thoughts on the world, when I find the time.
							I rarely do.

							I write stuff sometimes. I tried for a summer to actually complete writing projects
							and failed, now they come and go as I have ideas, work on them for a week, then move
							on to new things. The small list of things I have finished
							<a href="filemissing.html">can be viewed here,</a>

							I have built and operated a series of small blacksmithing forges with friends.
							They have invariably met with unfortunate fates, between component failure
							(it turns out thrift store hairdryers don't take operation in direct sun and pouring rain
							too well)
							to collapse due to poor structural design, to one that burnt itself down.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our next goal is to upgrade to propane, with the designs for the new forge
							done in our heads, and so far failing to be something we are actually capable of building.

							For many years my primary hobby was game development, with little success. My old game ideas
							file has about 20 entries, with most having been at least started at some point, invaribly
							with undue optimism. I used to compete in game jams (primarily Ludum Dare) back when I
							was in high school and had free weekends. I hope to someday get back into it, once I don't
							have as much calculus to contend with.

						<p>
							Created as a Valentine's Day gift, my first foray into PCB design was simple. It combined an
							ATTiny microcontroller, display driver, and LED matrix to present a red beating heart.
							I still managed to take two revisions to get the routing right somehow.

							I learned a lot in the year between this and my previous design. This one came complete
							with a less capable microcontroller, no user input, and a more annoying battery. It has a

							For a long time I worked without a proper lab power supply. The reasonable solution would
							have been to buy a cheap one on Amazon, or build one myself out of an old PC supply.
							Naturally I chose to design a board instead that gives me very limited voltage range, no
							current limiting, no power monitoring, and no effeciency. This is probably due for an
							upgrade.

							I currently serve as the team's low-voltage lead for both our Hyperloop research and Tunnel
							Boring Machine projects. I've learned a lot from working on the team, from board design and

							I'll be honest, I'm a lot more proud of this website than I should be. My introduction to
							software was actually with HTML, reading an old library book from back when Perl was still
							relevant. Despite it being my first contact with programming, it wasn't until this project
							that I built something properly in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, or for the web at all for that
							matter.
